# Bugfix Workflow

## Context

- This rule guides the AI and user through the process of implementing a bugfix and correctly incorporating Changeset for versioning.
- Apply this rule when a user expresses intent to start working on fixing a bug.

## Requirements

- **Sync:** Instruct the user to pull the latest changes from `main`.
- **Branch:** Guide the user to create and checkout a new branch for the bugfix following a consistent naming convention (e.g., `fix/<bug-description>`).
- **Implement:** Acknowledge the bugfix implementation phase (AI should assist with coding as requested separately).
- **Add Changeset:** The AI will run `bun x changeset`. This command is interactive.
    - The AI should guide the user through the terminal prompts.
    - The AI should suggest a `patch` version bump, as bugfixes are typically patch releases in semantic versioning.
    - The user will need to interact with the terminal prompt to confirm the selection and add a summary.
- **Commit:** The AI will stage all relevant changes (including the `.changeset` file(s)) and create a descriptive commit message following Conventional Commits (e.g., `fix: brief description of bugfix`).
    - The AI will write the commit message to a temporary file (e.g., `.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG`) using `echo -e` with `\n` for newlines.
    - The AI will then create the commit using `git commit -F .git/COMMIT_EDITMSG`.
- **Push:** The AI will push the bugfix branch to the remote repository.
- **PR:** Instruct the user to open a pull request for the bugfix branch, targeting the main development branch (`main` or `develop`).
- Ensure the AI initiates the `bun x changeset` command, provides guidance during the interactive process (suggesting 'patch'), handles staging/committing using the described method, and pushes the branch.

## Examples

<example>
  description: AI initiates changeset and suggests patch bump for bugfix
  ```
Okay, you've finished implementing the bugfix. I will now run `bun x changeset` for you. Since this is a bugfix, it should be a `patch` change. Please follow the prompts in the terminal to confirm and add a summary.
  ```
</example>

<example type="invalid">
  description: AI suggests minor or major bump for a bugfix
  ```
Okay, I'm running bun x changeset. What kind of change is this?
  ```
</example>
<example>
  description: AI stages and commits bugfix changes
  ```
Okay, I have staged all the relevant changes for the bugfix. I will now create the commit.
  ```
