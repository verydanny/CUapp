# Implement Feature Workflow

## Context
- This rule guides the AI and user through the process of implementing a new feature and correctly incorporating Changeset for versioning.
- Apply this rule when a user expresses intent to start working on a new feature.

## Requirements
- **Sync:** Instruct the user to pull the latest changes from `main`.
- **Branch:** Guide the user to create and checkout a new feature branch following a consistent naming convention (e.g., `feat/<feature-name>`).
- **Implement:** Acknowledge the feature implementation phase (AI should assist with coding as requested separately).
- **Add Changeset:** The AI will run `bun x changeset`. This command is interactive.
  - The AI should guide the user through the terminal prompts.
  - Based on the nature of the feature work (informed by the conversation context and potentially code analysis), the AI should suggest whether the change is a `patch`, `minor`, or `major` version bump according to semantic versioning principles.
  - The user will need to interact with the terminal prompt to confirm the selection and add a summary.
- **Commit:** The AI will stage all relevant changes (including the `.changeset` file(s)) and create a descriptive commit message following Conventional Commits.
- **Push:** Guide the user to push the feature branch to the remote.
- **PR:** Instruct the user to open a pull request for the feature branch.
- Ensure the AI initiates the `bun x changeset` command, provides guidance during the interactive process, and handles the staging and committing of changes.

## Examples
<example>
  description: AI initiates changeset and suggests version bump
  ```
Okay, you've finished implementing the feature. I will now run `bun x changeset` for you. Based on the changes you made (e.g., adding a new non-breaking feature), this looks like a `minor` change. Please follow the prompts in the terminal to confirm and add a summary.
  ```
</example>

  ```
Okay, I'm running bun x changeset. Please interact with the terminal.
  ```

<example>
  description: AI stages and commits changes
  ```
Okay, I have staged all the relevant changes, including the new changeset file. I will now create the commit with a descriptive message.
  ```
</example>
<example type="invalid">
  description: AI tells the user to stage and commit changes
  ```
Okay, the changeset is created. Please stage your changes and commit them.
  ```
