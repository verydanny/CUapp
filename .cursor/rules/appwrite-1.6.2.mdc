## Common CLI Commands (General Appwrite CLI Structure)

The Appwrite CLI follows a pattern like `appwrite [SERVICE] [ACTION] --[OPTIONS]`.
Always refer to `appwrite help` or `appwrite [SERVICE] --help` for the most accurate and version-specific commands.

- **Login to Appwrite:**
    ```bash
    appwrite login
    appwrite login --endpoint "YOUR_CUSTOM_ENDPOINT" # For self-hosted
    ```
- **Initialize Project:** (Connects CLI to your Appwrite project and creates/updates `appwrite.json`)
    ```bash
    appwrite init project
    ```
- **Deploy Collections:** (Based on definitions in `appwrite.json`)
    ```bash
    # Ensure you are in the directory containing appwrite.json or its parent .appwrite/
    appwrite deploy collection --all # Deploys all collections
    appwrite deploy collection --collectionId "YOUR_COLLECTION_ID" # Deploys a specific collection
    ```
- **Deploy Functions:**
    ```bash
    appwrite deploy function --all # Deploys all functions
    appwrite deploy function --functionId "YOUR_FUNCTION_ID" # Deploys a specific function
    ```
- **Managing CLI Configuration:**
    ```bash
    appwrite client --selfSigned true # To allow self-signed certificates (dev environments)
    appwrite client --debug # View current CLI configuration
    appwrite client --reset # Reset CLI configuration
    ```

## Key Architectural Concepts & Notes for 1.6.2

- **`appwrite.json`:** This file remains central for defining your project's schema (collections, functions, etc.) and is used by the CLI for deployments.
- **Permissions:** Appwrite uses a robust permission system. Ensure you understand document and collection-level permissions.
- **Functions:** The 1.6.x line significantly enhanced functions. Explore scheduled executions, dynamic API keys, and new runtimes if these are relevant to your needs.
- **Migration:** For 1.6.2, even if upgrading from an earlier 1.6.x version, the changelog explicitly states to run the `migrate` command. This is a critical step. The specific command is usually run within your Appwrite Docker environment (e.g., `docker compose exec appwrite migrate`).
- **Self-Hosting:** For self-hosted instances, always follow the official upgrade guides carefully, paying attention to Docker commands and potential migration steps.
