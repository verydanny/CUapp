# CU App

This is a SvelteKit social network app. It's built with:

- Bun
- Deno
- Appwrite
- SvelteKit
- TailwindCSS
- DaisyUI

The backend/database is Appwrite, and the SvelteKit runtime will be Deno. It uses Bun for the build/development process, simply for the package manager.

## Development

```bash
bun install
bun run dev
```

## Deployment

```bash
bun run build
bun run preview # for local testing
```
